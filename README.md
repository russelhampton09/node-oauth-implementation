# Learning Project #

## About Me ##

I work full time as a C# developer already. I wanted to learn more about other frameworks.

## Project goals ##


Fully implement an oauth server. Using libraries is OK.  
If session information is to be stored, use Mongodb.  
Include a postman playbook for testing.
